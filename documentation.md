# File

XBrowser uses **XMLV** a XML extension as its layout standard. All display elements should be included in the XMLV file. Once the resource has been retrieved the web browser will display it. A XMLV file is pretty much similar to HTML file used by normal browsers. It included a root element xmlv and title attribute, following is an example of XMLV file:

```xml
<xmlv title="Hello XMLV"/>
```

There are two types of xmlv elements: nouns elements and verbs elements.

## Noun Elements

## <a name="preload"></a>Preload
## <a name="json"></a>JSON
## <a name="css"></a>CSS

## Verb Elements

## <a name="script"></a>Script
## <a name="class"></a>Class
